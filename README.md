# Movie-Recommender-System-
Movie Recommender System using collaborative and content-based filtering for personalized movie suggestions
(Built with Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn)


## Overview  
A Movie Recommender System built with Python that provides personalized movie suggestions based on user preferences. It combines **collaborative filtering** and **content-based filtering** techniques to recommend movies that users are likely to enjoy.

## Objectives  

### User Personalization  
- Analyze user ratings and viewing history to generate relevant movie recommendations.  
- Use collaborative filtering to recommend movies based on similarities between users.  
- Implement content-based filtering to suggest movies with similar features (genres, actors, directors).  

### System Functionality  
- Load and preprocess movie and rating datasets for effective training.  
- Build and evaluate recommendation models using similarity metrics and machine learning algorithms.  
- Provide recommendations through a simple command-line interface or script.  
- Handle challenges like sparse data and cold-start problems efficiently.

## Key Insights  
- Utilized Python libraries like Pandas and NumPy for data handling and manipulation.  
- Applied collaborative filtering to capture user-user or item-item similarity.  
- Leveraged content-based filtering by extracting movie metadata features.  
- Combined both approaches for improved recommendation quality.  
- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand user behavior and movie trends.

## Recommendations  

### Enhancements  
- Develop a hybrid recommendation engine to combine collaborative and content-based methods more seamlessly.  
- Build a web or desktop GUI for easier user interaction.  
- Incorporate user feedback loops to refine and personalize recommendations further.  

### Technical Improvements  
- Explore advanced algorithms like matrix factorization (SVD) or deep learning methods.  
- Include additional features such as user demographics, reviews, or social data.  
- Optimize data preprocessing and model training for scalability on large datasets.

## Conclusion  
This Movie Recommender System effectively demonstrates the use of machine learning to solve personalization challenges. With further enhancements in algorithm sophistication and interface design, it can deliver highly accurate and user-friendly movie recommendations, improving user engagement and satisfaction.
